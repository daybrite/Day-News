//! The wall clock and the reader's UTC offset, asked of the host.
//!
//! Day-News needs exactly two facts about time-of-day, and neither is in the standard library
//! everywhere this app runs:
//!
//! - **Now.** `SystemTime::now()` traps on `wasm32-unknown-unknown` rather than failing, so the
//!   web build asks the page for `Date.now()`.
//! - **The local UTC offset at an instant, DST included.** "Today" is a claim about the reader's
//!   calendar, so the timeline's cut-off is local midnight rather than UTC midnight — and turning
//!   an instant into a local one needs the reader's zone rules.
//!
//! Those rules come from the host, never from a database shipped in the binary: POSIX
//! `localtime_r` reads the platform's own zoneinfo, Win32 converts through the zone the machine
//! is set to, and on web the browser's `Intl` implementation answers. Every one of them is
//! already installed and already kept current, where a bundled IANA database is ~200 KB that goes
//! stale between releases.
//!
//! An unanswerable offset is `None` rather than a guess; callers read that as UTC, which is the
//! same thing a machine with no zone configured would say.
