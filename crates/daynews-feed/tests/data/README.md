# Captured feed fixtures

Real feeds, saved byte for byte as their publishers served them on 2026-09-01, for
`real_feeds.rs` to parse offline. Each takes a shape the parser has to get right. The app does not
bundle them: its screenshots and walkthrough read the demo feeds in `resource/assets/demo/`,
written for Day News, which `demo_feeds.rs` covers.

| File | Source | Shape |
|---|---|---|
| `nasa.xml` | https://www.nasa.gov/feed/ | WordPress RSS 2.0: `content:encoded` bodies, `dc:creator` |
| `quanta.xml` | https://www.quantamagazine.org/feed/ | WordPress RSS 2.0: `content:encoded`, `media:` thumbnails |
| `sciencedaily.xml` | https://www.sciencedaily.com/rss/all.xml | Plain RSS 2.0, summary-only items |
| `merriam-webster.xml` | https://www.merriam-webster.com/wotd/feed/rss2 | Plain RSS 2.0, HTML in `description` |
| `rust-forum.xml` | https://users.rust-lang.org/c/announcements/6.rss | Discourse RSS 2.0, `dc:creator` usernames |
| `rust-blog.xml` | https://blog.rust-lang.org/feed.xml | Atom with full `content` |
| `rust-mastodon.xml` | https://social.rust-lang.org/@rust.rss | Mastodon RSS 2.0; items carry no `<title>` |

Each publisher keeps the copyright in its own content. The files are parser fixtures, captured
verbatim and unedited. To refresh one, fetch its URL again, replace the file, and run
`cargo test -p daynews-feed`: the tests assert on shape (titles, ids, links, entity decoding), not
on particular articles, so a fresh capture passes without edits.

`dayscript/seed-mobile.yaml` subscribes to the live originals, and `dayscript/import.yaml` imports
them from `crates/daynews-opml/tests/data/daynews.opml`.
